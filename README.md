# List of Arduino Files

## Descriptions
This repository contains a collection of Arduino files used in various machines to implement robotic functionalities and automate movements and actions.

## Usage
- **Bomb_game.ino**: This file creates a simple bomb game designed to be played by groups or couples to test their trust in each other. The game involves one person acting as a "hostage" while the other attempts to defuse the "bomb" (a balloon above the hostage's head). If the defusal is unsuccessful, the "bomb" will "explode."
- **boxStorage.ino**: This file automates the process of accepting cards. When a card is placed in the box, it automatically opens and arranges the card.
- **timing_game.ino**: This script tests the reaction time of the player by displaying a pattern of LEDs. If the pattern is not replicated correctly, the player loses.
- **Room_program.ino**: This script handles automation within a room, such as turning on lights based on object detection and ensuring security measures are in place.

## Programming Language
The programs are written in a combination of C++ and C.

## Installations
To utilize these scripts, upload them to an Arduino UNO board and ensure proper connection to the required components as per the schematic.
